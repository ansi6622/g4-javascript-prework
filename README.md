# g4: January, JavaScript & Juxtaposition

After the break you will begin programming client-side, single page applications with Ember.js. You will learn to master frontend technologies like JavaScript, HTML5, Ajax, & Sass. You will learn JavaScript *the language* & Ember.js, a client-side MVC, to help you build ambitious web applications on top of a hand rolled Ruby on Rails API.

## Why Ember

It's said that it doesn't matter what client side, JavaScript MVC you learn, as long as you learn one. We chose to teach Ember because, in addition to it being wonderful, it also:

* Uses an MVC like design pattern, which will reinforce your understanding of the Rails MVC. While different than Rails, there are many similarities between the two.

* Is decoupled from the server, which lets us continue learning Rails. With the advent of innumerable devices, a modern architecture often demands client side code to be separate from code that serves application data. With Ember, single page, client side apps are built on top of an API. In this way, programmers build a single API that feeds any number of client side applications. While you learn how to use Ember, you will also learn how to build a server side API that serves JSON, which will reinforce everything we're already learning in Rails.

* Uses JavaScript templates (Handlebars / HTMLBars) for separation of concerns. Any JS framework worth its salt provides a way to dynamically produce HTML. Like Meteor.js & React.js, Ember uses a technology called a virtual DOM that helps developers meet the snappy expectations of users of the modern web.

* Closely tied to the Rails community (core Ember developers are shared by core Rails developers).

* Employable. While engineers graduate from jQuery and Backbone, more and more teams jump ship from Angular.js to build more and more apps with Ember.js. The demand for client-side MVC experience is higher than ever and Ember is on the rise.

## Required Preparation

Ember.js is rapidly evolving as the core team builds up to Ember.js 2.0. Consequently, many resources are out of date; almost everything written before 2014 is no longer applicable. There is no need to begin learning Ember over the holiday and we encourage you to focus exclusively on the material provided here instead.

Over the break, I've assigned required course work for you to complete. There will be an assessment on the required material. The required work shouldn't take more than 10 hour to complete, so you can still enjoy your holiday.

Incase you complete all of the required work and are still hungry to learn more, I've also included some recommended material to help you get ahead.

### JavaScript

#### [NodeSchool: JavaScripting](https://github.com/sethvincent/javascripting) (required)
Level: Beginner  
Estimate Time: 1 - 2 hours

This walks you through the very basics of JavaScirpt. We will help you set up Node.js and NPM before the break.

#### [Try jQuery](http://try.jquery.com/) (required)
Level: Beginner  
Estimate Time: 3 - 4 hours

This will introduce you to JavaScript as it relates to interacting with HTML in the browser. You can use the linked title or jump straight to [the first video](http://try.jquery.com/levels/1/sections/2) here.

### [Eloquent JavaScript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/) (required)
Level: Beginner  
Estimate Time: 3 - 4 hours

This is a free, wonderful book that simply explains JavaScript in greater depth. Try to complete all of the exercises on your own, but we will review different solutions to each after the break.

#### Explore the console

You can start playing with JavaScript immediately by opening up Chrome Dev Tools (CMND + Option + J). This is the console where you can write and play with JavaScript directly. This is also where 'console.log()' sends values from JavaScript programs.

#### [Discover Dev Tools](http://discover-devtools.codeschool.com/)
Chapters 1, 2, and 3 will go a long way towards becoming an efficient JavaScript developer. The other chapters are not needed until much, much later, so I would only go through the first three.

We will go over all of this again in class, but feel free to get a head start.

#### [JavaScript for Cats](http://jsforcats.com/)

Level: Beginner  
Estimate Time: 1 hour

This short article introduces some of the very basics in JavaScript. It will help ease you into JavaScript's data types and unique syntax.

### Ruby

If you complete the required material and need a break from JavaScript, here are some cool Ruby resources.

#### [Design Patterns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dIS8awh5oU&list=PL-c5QGKgN2C-DPNGN4lkN3BxT2Ea2gU2V&index=5)

This course explores program design in pure Ruby. It assumes a broad understanding of the language and will expose you to some new methods, so be sure to look up what something does if you don't know it.

#### [Bastard's Book on Ruby](http://ruby.bastardsbook.com/chapters/web-scraping/)

Try building a web scraper with Ruby! This is one of the first Ruby resoures I ever went through, so it's pretty old, but should still be relevant today. You can see some other cool chapters in the [Table of Contents](http://ruby.bastardsbook.com/toc/).
